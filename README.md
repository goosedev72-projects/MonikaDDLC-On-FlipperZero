# Flipper Zero asset pack with Monika from DDLC

This is a fan work, based on Monika from DDLC by Team Salvato (go try it!), the inspiration for facial expressions (based on assets/Icons/Passport icons) is by @KingBophades!

## Structure

- assets - the main asset pack source
  - Anims - Monika animations on the home screen
  - Icons - Monika icons and assets in apps (like Sub-GHz scanning or RFID emulation) and Passport icons
- development - extra assets for developing your own animations or icons
  - expressions - Monika's facial expressions adapted for Flipper format
  
## Compiling
You must have installed Python3 and clone the repository (of course).
First, of course, clone the repo.

Then you must install dependencies for the asset packer (which will adapt files for Flipper).
```bash
pip3 install heatshrink2 Pillow
```

Move your assets folder
